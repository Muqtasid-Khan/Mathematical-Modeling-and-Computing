## Newton-Raphson Method

The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to equations of the form \( f(x) = 0 \). It uses the formula:

\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

### For Example 

python
def newton_raphson(f, df, x0, tol=1e-7, max_iter=100):
    """
    Newton-Raphson Method for finding roots.
    
    Parameters:
    f : function
        The function whose root is to be found.
    df : function
        Derivative of the function f.
    x0 : float
        Initial guess for the root.
    tol : float, optional
        Tolerance for stopping criterion.
    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations.
        
    Returns:
    float
        Approximate root of the function.
    """
    xn = x0
    for n in range(max_iter):
        fxn = f(xn)
        if abs(fxn) < tol:
            print(f"Found solution after {n} iterations.")
            return xn
        dfxn = df(xn)
        if dfxn == 0:
            print("Zero derivative. No solution found.")
            return None
        xn = xn - fxn / dfxn
    print("Exceeded maximum iterations. No solution found.")
    return None

# For Example 
f = lambda x: x**3 - x - 2
df = lambda x: 3*x**2 - 1
root = newton_raphson(f, df, x0=1.5)
print(f"Root: {root}")

## Regular Falsi Method

The Regular Falsi method, or False Position method, is a bracketing method for finding roots. It uses the formula:

\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n) \cdot (x_n - x_{n-1})}{f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1})} \]

### Example Code

def regular_falsi(f, a, b, tol=1e-7, max_iter=100):
    """
    Regular Falsi (False Position) Method for finding roots.
    
    Parameters:
    f : function
        The function whose root is to be found.
    a : float
        Lower bound of the interval.
    b : float
        Upper bound of the interval.
    tol : float, optional
        Tolerance for stopping criterion.
    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations.
        
    Returns:
    float
        Approximate root of the function.
    """
    if f(a) * f(b) >= 0:
        print("The function must have different signs at the endpoints a and b.")
        return None
    
    for n in range(max_iter):
        c = b - f(b) * (b - a) / (f(b) - f(a))
        if abs(f(c)) < tol:
            print(f"Found solution after {n} iterations.")
            return c
        if f(c) * f(a) < 0:
            b = c
        else:
            a = c
    print("Exceeded maximum iterations. No solution found.")
    return None

# Example usage
f = lambda x: x**3 - x - 2
root = regular_falsi(f, a=1, b=2)
print(f"Root: {root}")
